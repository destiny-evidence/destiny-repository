<area shape="rect" id="node4" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.AbstractContentEnhancement

An enhancement which is specific to the abstract of a reference.

1. Abstracts are increasingly missing from sources like OpenAlex, and may be
backfilled from other sources, without the bibliographic metadata.
2. They are also subject to copyright limitations in ways which metadata are
not, and thus need separate visibility controls.
