Core reference model with database attributes included.
" alt="" coords="1164,259,1596,483"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node3" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.AbstractContentEnhancement

An enhancement which is specific to the abstract of a reference.

This is separate from the `BibliographicMetadata` for two reasons:

1. Abstracts are increasingly missing from sources like OpenAlex, and may be
backfilled from other sources, without the bibliographic metadata.
2. They are also subject to copyright limitations in ways which metadata are
not, and thus need separate visibility controls.
" alt="" coords="1156,1235,1604,1347"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node4" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.AnnotationEnhancement

An enhancement which is composed of a list of Annotations.
" alt="" coords="1145,671,1615,755"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node5" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.BibliographicMetadataEnhancement

An enhancement which is made up of bibliographic metadata.

Generally this will be sourced from a database such as OpenAlex or similar.
For directly contributed references, these may not be complete.
" alt="" coords="1133,803,1627,1055"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node6" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.LocationEnhancement

An enhancement which describes locations where this reference can be found.

This maps closely (almost exactly) to OpenAlex&#39;s locations.
" alt="" coords="1158,1103,1602,1187"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node7" title="app.domain.references.models.models.LinkedExternalIdentifier

" alt="" coords="1771,145,2397,285"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node12" title="app.domain.references.models.models.ReferenceDuplicateDecision

<area shape="rect" id="node13" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.BooleanAnnotation

An annotation is a way of tagging the content with a label of some kind.

This class will probably be broken up in the future, but covers most of our
initial cases.
" alt="" coords="1883,633,2285,829"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node14" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.ScoreAnnotation

An annotation which represents the score for a label.

This is similar to a BooleanAnnotation, but lacks a boolean determination
as to the application of the label.
" alt="" coords="1897,878,2271,1046"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node15" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.Authorship

Represents a single author and their association with a reference.

This is a simplification of the OpenAlex [Authorship
object](https://docs.openalex.org/api&#45;entities/works/work&#45;object/authorship&#45;object)
for our purposes.
" alt="" coords="1970,1094,2198,1206"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node16" title="destiny_sdk.enhancements.Location

A location where a reference can be found.

This maps almost completely to the OpenAlex
[Location object](https://docs.openalex.org/api&#45;entities/works/work&#45;object/location&#45;object)
" alt="" coords="1935,1255,2233,1451"/>
