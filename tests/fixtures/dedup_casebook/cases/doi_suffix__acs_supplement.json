  "notes": "DOI suffix pattern: .s[0-9]{3,}. Main article and supplements have identical metadata (title, authors, year, journal) but are different objects. Supplement DOI contains main DOI as prefix. These are distinct downloadable assets - main article is the PDF, .s001 might be supplementary methods, .s002 might be data tables. Policy options: (1) filter supplement DOIs at ingestion, (2) treat as NOT_DUPLICATE but link to parent DOI, (3) store but mark as supplementary material type. For evidence synthesis, supplements are probably not primary evidence sources."
