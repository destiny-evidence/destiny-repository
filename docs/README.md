# Sphinx Documentation

This is a simple sphinx implementation to add domain model and procedure documentation.

Over time we will expand this to include formal function documentation and host on Github.

To view the docs:

```sh
open docs/html/index.html
```

To build the docs:

```sh
cd docs
sphinx-build -b html . html
```
